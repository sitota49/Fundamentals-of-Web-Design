                                After signing up to do volunteer work at a nearby NGO named the Young Women Christian Association, I realized that each and every one of us were living in our own world not caring about what happens to the people in our community .

I was assigned to teach summer tutorial classes for first graders. I was responsible for my class as I would schedule their daily activities. I had to be a role model to my students as they would look up to me.

Most of the children came from the less privileged part of the society, there were times they would feel dizzy in class as they would only have a single meal a day. During that cold rainy season most wear torn clothes and some didnâ€™t have any shoes. Some came one day and would be absent the following day as they would have to work or support their parents who were in worse condition.

The program provided me an opportunity to help the kids in every single way I could. In groups we tried our best to fundraise money to buy them school supplies that they would use the coming year. We also tried our best to help a few who were in severe condition.

As a reward to our services the organization gave all volunteers a life skill and leadership training. It was not about the reward but I am glad that I learned what humanity and compassion are that summer. Being there for a person who is really in need is the best form of humanity. It is a life principle I am taking on till the end.
