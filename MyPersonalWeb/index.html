                   <p align="justify">My name is Sitota Ezra. I was born October 11, 2000. I live with my parents and little sister, Aryam, in Addis Ababa,Ethiopia.<br>

                        Some of my hobbies include listening to music and watching movies.I am an easy to get along person and I have a large group of friends. I enjoy spending time with friends and family.<br>
                        
                        Currently, I'm a studying Software Engineering at <u><a href="http://www.aait.edu.et/"> Addis Ababa University Institute of Technology</a></u>. <br><br>
                        
                        Eventough, catching up to the college life has its own struggles, I am glad to be one of the few to get into this amazing school. Within in these 2 years, I have seen what it is like to be independent, what living away from home feels like and most of all how hard work pays off as long as you are dedicated.<br>
                        
                        Joining Addis Ababa Institute of Technology and mostly the Software department has made me one step closer to my dream of being a succesful programmer in the future. Programming is all about solving problems and solving problems has its back end to benefiting the society we live in. And personally, I for one belive that, that is our goal in life. Giving back to the society who brought us up making sacrifices.<br>
                        
                        I want to give back I want to give back to my parents, I want to give back to my freinds and I want to give back to my society. Thats what motivates me keeps me going every single day to work hard and achieve my dreams.<br>
