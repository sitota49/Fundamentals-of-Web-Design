                                One of the greatest problems that our planet currently faces is the problem of global warming. We hear about it almost every day on the media. One of the main contributors to this problem is the existence of toxic waste. This waste is mostly described as poisonous byproducts of industries, farms, garages, laboratories, hospitals and the like but it also needs to emphasize the waste that comes out of our own houses.<br><br>

Even though most people are educated about waste management starting from their kindergarten days, it seems that that knowledge has suddenly disappeared. It has become very common to see piled up waste in most localities, villages and cities of the world. Recently, I read an article in a National Geography publication that this waste can harm humans, animals, and plants if they encounter the toxins buried in the ground, in stream runoffs or in the groundwater that supplies drinking water. The statement hit me hard with the realization that we are preparing our own death!!!<br><br>

The publication also gave a link to a statement made by the former American vice president Al Gore, who said. “Today we're dumping 70 million tons of global-warming pollution into the environment, and tomorrow we will dump more, and there is no effective worldwide response.”<br><br>

In an effort to somehow make a difference, I wrote an article for my class on how I noticed most people in our city get rid of waste in a way that is ultimately endangering the society.<br><br>

In the article , I stated that it is the responsibility of every individual to manage waste. Parents have the responsibility to teach their children on how to dispose waste properly, it starts from putting the candy covers and chewing gum papers in the trash can. Every household will need to put the proper waste disposal devises in place. Every school will need to put in place proper guidelines in keeping classrooms and the school compound clean. I also wrote that it is the responsibility of the city administration to put in place proper garbage collection mechanisms and the government will need to commit funds towards this activity. This endeavor also needs to be supported by proper rules, regulations and enforcement for people to abide by them.<br><br>

I wrote the article with the intention of making a difference through awareness creation within my school. What I didn’t know was that my teacher was so impressed with it that she sent the article to the regional government office for a writing competition. It so happened that the regional office was also impressed by the way a high school student noticed this grave problem and tried to flag it out. My article won first place in the competition but that was not my biggest reward. My biggest reward was that after that article was presented, our school started to take measures on proper waste management and disposal methods. Everyone started using separate trashcans to dispose dry, recyclable and plastic materials. This brought about a significant change in the attitudes of the students who later testified that they practice the lessons learned not only at school but also at their homes. As Bob Proctor said, “It’s the little things that you do that can make a big difference.”<br><br>
